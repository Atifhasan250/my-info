## Deployment

This project is optimized for deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), the platform from the creators of Next.js.

To deploy your version of Linkify, follow these steps:

1.  Push your code to a new GitHub repository.
2.  Go to the [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/new) and import your repository.
3.  Vercel will automatically detect that you are using Next.js and will configure the build settings for you.
4.  Deploy! Your Linkify app will be live on a public URL.

The included `vercel.json` file ensures that the deployment process is smooth and requires no manual configuration.
